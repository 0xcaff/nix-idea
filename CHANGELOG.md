# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for IDEA 2020.3
### Removed
- Support for IDEA 2019.3
## [0.3.0.3]
### Fixed
- Change ID of plugin back from `org.nixos.idea` in version 0.3.0.0 to
  `nix-idea` from earlier versions. The different ID of version 0.3.0.0
  causes *IntelliJ* and *JetBrains Marketplace* to treat version 0.3.0.0
  as a different plugin instead of another version of the same plugin.
  **Note that if you installed version 0.3.0.0 manually from the ZIP
  file, you should uninstall it when updating to a new version.**
## [0.3.0.0]
### Changed
- Update project to build for recent IJ versions
